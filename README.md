Project Dragon is a sustainability-focused city builder where you play as nature itself, growing mycelial networks and plants, and fighting against threats such as droughts, pollution, clear cutting, river diversions, extreme weather, and more.

We are currently building a small-scope prototype in Unreal Engine 5.
